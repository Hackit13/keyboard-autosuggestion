I built a Python project that can provide suggestions based on user input.
The project utilizes textdistance library for measuring similarity between words, and pandas for data manipulation.
By leveraging techniques like Jaccard similarity and probabilistic models, I tried to create an efficient and accurate auto suggestion system.
